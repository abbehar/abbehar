### Project Information

* Tracking the development of 2020 US alternative music and corresponding 2020 US historical events
* Correlation doesn't necessarily imply causation, but it is an interesting glimpse into how context coincides with song
* 2020 was a year of dynamism and flux--did the alternative music play out as such?
* It is important to note that the alternative music data for this project was derived from radio airplays, meaning that it may not be reflective of cultural preference but of capitalistically motivated choice
